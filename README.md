## Structure
Nursing triage tool which accepts input symptoms from users, the tool will prioritise the most serious symptoms according to the UKONS triage tool and rank the users names in terms of severity. The most serious symptoms will be at the top of the list for the nurse to then assess.

## Included features
- :heart: Use of data-attributes to navigate through assessment questions.
- :orange_heart: Virtual waiting room.
- :yellow_heart: NHS COVID widget.
- :green_heart: COVID API for current countries.
- :blue_heart: Feature to copy "ticket number" to clipboard.
- :purple_heart: Accessible and responsive.

## Improvements and futures ideas
- add feature for patients who have waited over a certain time to be 'bumped' up the queue.
- patients given rough time for waiting depending on amount of patients in the queue.
- use cypress testing
